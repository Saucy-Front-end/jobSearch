This is the companion code for a blog post about finding my first programming job 
as a self taught developer.  You can find the [blog post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-dynamic-framework-for-finding-your-first-programming-job-b4eb0605b4f3#.ce90pn3s7) on Medium.

This repo contains the problem in the `jobSearch.js` file in the root directory.
I've also included a basic test suite as well and some solutions that were
presented in the blog post.

To run the test suite you will need mocha and chai as dependencies.

To work on this problem follow these steps in your terminal emulator:

1) Install the dependencies:
`npm install`

2) Run the test suite
`npm run test`

3) Edit jobSearch.js until all the tests pass.
